# Sorting Visualizer

Welcome to the Sorting Visualizer project! This project allows you to visualize various sorting algorithms in action.

## Overview

This sorting visualizer provides a graphical representation of different sorting algorithms. It is a helpful tool for understanding how sorting algorithms work and comparing their efficiency.

## Features

- Visualization of popular sorting algorithms such as:
  - Bubble Sort
  - Selection Sort
  - Insertion Sort
  - Merge Sort
  - Quick Sort
- Adjustable array size and speed of visualization.
